Collaborated with a group of classmates to design and develop a database management system for a taxi company.  Utilized project management skills and database design knowledge 
to ensure successful project completion within specified timelines. The "COMP 230 GROUP PROJECT" file contains the full project with examples of queries that could be ran for the 
database that we created. The "SQLScript" file contains the full script for the database.
